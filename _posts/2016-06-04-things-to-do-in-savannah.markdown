We fell in love with Savannah from our very first visit. The architecture, the food, the history and the people all provide an amazing backdrop for our wedding and reception.

While you're in Savannah, we'd encourage you to spend time exploring the city and enjoying some of our favorite things. Here's a few we think you'll love.

## History

_The Mercer Williams House located at 429 Bull Street._

Be sure to walk Forsyth Park and see their iconic fountain located at the corner of Drayton Street & W Gaston Street.

Bonaventure Cemetery is Savannah’s oldest cemetery, immortalized in best-selling book, “Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil”. It's located at 330 Bonaventure Rd, Thunderbolt, GA 31404 and is worth getting lost in.

Other stunning history sites include the Cathedral of St. John the Baptist located at 222 E Harris St and Juliette Gorden Low's birthplace (founder of the Girl Scouts) located at 10 E Oglethorpe Ave.


## Food

_Paula Deen’s restaurant, Lady & Sons, is located at 102 W Congress St. A reservation is highly encouraged, give them a call at 912.233.2600_

Stop by The Olde Pink House’s Basement Restaurant & Lounge located at 23 Abercorn Street for a drink and to take in the antebellum history strewn throughout this beautiful restaurant.

Finally, treat yourself to a cone at Leopold’s Ice Cream located at 212 E Broughton St!


## Outdoors & Tours

![Jekyll Island](/images/jekyll.jpg)
_Jekyll Island is located off the coast of the U.S. state of Georgia, in Glynn County. It is one of the Sea Islands and one of the Golden Isles of Georgia barrier islands. This sleepy beach town boasts some stunning views and delicious restaurants. It's also the place we got engaged, at Jekyll's iconic Driftwood Beach._
