If you choose to rent a car to get around Savannah, you'll be all set. Wormsloe is a short drive from downtown Savannah, and you can park there onsite.

Back downtown, there's a variety of parking spots available near Garibaldi's. We are looking into reserving parking spaces there and will update this page with additional details.

You can also easily cab or Uber your way to and from the ceremony.
