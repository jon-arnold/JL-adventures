## Coach Transportation

Our ceremony will take place at Wormsloe Historic Site, which has limited parking. The site is roughly 20 minutes outside of historic downtown Savannah. To make this easy for everyone, we have a charter bus that will be waiting for you in front of Garibaldi's Cafe on Congress Street.

At 1PM ET, a bus will be waiting outside Garibaldi's to transport guests to the Wormsloe Historic Site for the ceremony.

### This bus will leave promptly at 1:15PM ET, so please be there early to get a good seat!

We will be providing sunscreen and bug spray since the ceremony is outdoors at a state park sheltered by live oaks and Spanish moss. If you have outdoor allergies, you may want to take allergy medicine before boarding so you’re comfortable throughout the 30-minute ceremony.

<p>
The bus will drop you off only a short walk away from the ceremony site. If you need assistance walking, golf cart transport will be there to help.

Once the ceremony is complete, the bus will then take you to Garibaldi's Cafe where hors d'oeuvres and cocktails will be awaiting you downstairs prior to our reception upstairs.

## Parking

We'd recommend you park near Garibaldi's restaurant, rather than at the ceremony itself (and take the coach transport). Near Garibaldi's, you'll find several parking spots and garages available for the evening.

### Robinson Parking Garage is a convenient garage, located at 132 Montgomery Street.

Here's a map between the garage and the restaurant:

Please note: You are most likely within walking distance of Garibaldi’s Cafe if you are staying within the historic downtown area.

## Driving Yourself

There is limited parking available at Wormsloe if you choose to drive yourself. Please let any official know you are there for the Arnold/DiVirgilio wedding, as we have already paid for your entrance to the park.


## Taxis & Transports

Choosing to take an Uber or taxi to the charter bus is an excellent idea. At the end of the night, you’ll be able to do the same from our reception site, Garibaldi’s Cafe, to get back to your respective hotel or lodging.

Savannah has Uber, which can be hailed from your phone, or plenty of taxi cab companies for you to call upon. Here are a few:

* Savannah Yellow Cab: (912) 208-5054
* Savannah Taxi Service: (912) 623-4080
* Chatham Cab: (912) 691-4466
