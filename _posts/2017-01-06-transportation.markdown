## Coach Transportation

At 1PM ET, a bus will be waiting outside Garibaldi's restaurant to transport guests to the Wormsloe Historic Site for the ceremony.

### This bus will leave promptly at 1:15PM ET, so please be there early to get a good seat!

<p>
The bus will drop you off only a short walk away from the ceremony site. If you need assistance walking, golf cart transport will be available.
</p>
After the ceremony, the bus will make a return trip to Garibaldi's in time for our cocktail hour and reception.

## Parking

There is limited parking available at Wormsloe if you choose to drive yourself.

However, we'd recommend you park near Garibaldi's restaurant, rather than at the ceremony itself (and take the coach transport). Near Garibaldi's, you'll find several parking spots and garages available for the evening.

### Robinson Parking Garage is a convenient garage, located at 132 Montgomery Street.

Here's a map between the garage and the restaurant:
