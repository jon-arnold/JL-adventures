Savannah is filled with stunning historic properties, and the neighborhoods in downtown Savannah are truly why it's been called the "Jewel of the South". Guests are encouraged to explore the city on an [architecture tour](https://architecturalsavannah.com/) or for the brave, a [ghost tour](https://ghostcitytours.com/savannah-ghost-tours/).

When staying in Savannah, you have many options, from the cozy to the classic. Each of these options are within walking distance of the ceremony and reception locations.

## Airbnb

Another excellent option to consider is finding a room for rent on Airbnb. [Savannah's page](https://www.airbnb.com/s/Savannah--GA?checkin=04%2F28%2F2017&checkout=04%2F30%2F2017&room_types%5B%5D=Entire+home%2Fapt&sw_lat=32.05753658675152&sw_lng=-81.10342005646027&ne_lat=32.079698427229815&ne_lng=-81.08118990814484&search_by_map=true&zoom=15&ss_id=kvnwoq4e) offers many unique places to stay with a delightful local touch.

No matter your choice, we hope your stay in Savannah is memorable and beautiful. We love this city and are so excited to share it with you!
