Savannah is filled with stunning historic properties, and the neighborhoods in downtown Savannah are truly why it's been called the "Jewel of the South". Guests are encouraged to explore the city on an [architecture tour](https://architecturalsavannah.com/) or for the brave, a [ghost tour](https://ghostcitytours.com/savannah-ghost-tours/).
