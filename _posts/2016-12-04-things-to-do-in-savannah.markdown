We fell in love with Savannah from our very first visit. The architecture, the food, the history and the people all provide an amazing backdrop for our wedding and reception.

While you're in Savannah, we'd encourage you to spend time exploring the city and enjoying some of our favorite things. Here's a few we think you'll love.
