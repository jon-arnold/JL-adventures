Our wedding ceremony will take place in beautiful Orleans Square in Savannah, Georgia. Our reception will take place at Garibaldi's restaurant (which also serves as our rain-out ceremony location).

Guests are encouraged to walk between the two locations. Not only will it be a beautiful day, but the historic neighborhoods and city squares shouldn't be missed.

### About Orleans Square

Orleans Square was laid out in 1815, commemorating General Andrew Jackson's victory at the Battle of New Orleans in January of that year. In the center of the square the German Memorial Fountain honors early German immigrants to Savannah. Installed in 1989 it commemorates the 250th anniversary of Georgia and of Savannah, as well as the 300th anniversary of the arrival in Philadelphia of 13 Rhenish families. Orleans Square is located on Barnard, between Hull and Perry Streets, and is adjacent to the Savannah Civic Center.

### About Garibaldi's

Garibaldi's is in yet another historic, beautiful building in downtown Savannah. You'll enjoy an extensive wine list and Italian cuisine. Their specialty, though, is seafood: don't miss out on the oysters!
