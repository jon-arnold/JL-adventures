Our wedding ceremony will take place in the beautiful Wormsloe Historical Site in Savannah, Georgia. Our reception will take place at Garibaldi's restaurant (which also serves as our rain-out ceremony location).

### About the Wormsloe Historic Site

A breathtaking avenue sheltered by live oaks and Spanish moss leads to the tabby ruins of Wormsloe, the colonial estate of Noble Jones (1702â€“1775). Jones was a humble carpenter who arrived in Georgia in 1733 with James Oglethorpe and the first group of settlers from England. Wormsloe's tabby ruin is the oldest standing structure in Savannah.

It's filled with history and breathtaking scenery for all to enjoy during our day.

### About Garibaldi's

Garibaldi's is in a historic, beautiful building in downtown Savannah. You'll enjoy an extensive wine list and Italian cuisine. Their specialty, though, is seafood: don't miss out on the oysters!
