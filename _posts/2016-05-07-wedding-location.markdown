Our wedding ceremony will take place in beautiful Orleans Square in Savannah, Georgia. Our reception will take place at the historic Harper Fowlkes House. The two locations are right across the street from one another.

Guests are encouraged to walk to the ceremony from their hotel or lodging. Not only will it be a beautiful day, but the historic neighborhoods and city squares shouldn't be missed.

### About Orleans Square

Orleans Square was laid out in 1815, commemorating General Andrew Jackson's victory at the Battle of New Orleans in January of that year. In the center of the square the German Memorial Fountain honors early German immigrants to Savannah. Installed in 1989 it commemorates the 250th anniversary of Georgia and of Savannah, as well as the 300th anniversary of the arrival in Philadelphia of 13 Rhenish families. Orleans Square is located on Barnard, between Hull and Perry Streets, and is adjacent to the Savannah Civic Center.

### About the Harper Fowlkes House

This Greek Revival mansion located in Savannah’s historic district was built in 1842 and restored by Alida Harper. A woman ahead of her time, Alida had a profound impact on the preservation of Savannah’s architectural traditions.  She was a savvy and serious self made woman who lived in the house for 45 years. As an antique dealer, she lovingly filled the house with period pieces and collectibles that remain today. She also owned a restaurant in the basement of the Pink House, called “The Georgian Tea Room” during the depression.

Born in 1908, Alida Harper loved the house as a young woman. She regularly rode on the Barnard Street trolley car, and when it passed the house, she stretched to see it, thinking “Some day I will own that house.”
