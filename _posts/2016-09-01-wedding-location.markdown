Our wedding ceremony will take place in the beautiful Wormsloe Historical Site in Savannah, Georgia. Our reception will take place at Garibaldi's restaurant (which also serves as our rain-out ceremony location).

## Rain Plan

Of course it’s going to be clear skies and 75 degrees with a light breeze on April 29, 2017. However, Lisa and Jon are both professional over-planners, so…

If there is rain the day of Lisa and Jon’s wedding, the ceremony and reception will both be held at Garibaldi’s Cafe.

### If you suspect inclement weather, please call this number to determine where the ceremony will be held: 615-866-5960

A message will be left to make sure you know what the plan is.

_Please note: either way you will arrive at Garibaldi’s Cafe that day, either to take the charter bus to Wormsloe Historic Site, or to attend the ceremony inside the building._

### About the Wormsloe Historic Site

A breathtaking avenue sheltered by live oaks and Spanish moss leads to the tabby ruins of Wormsloe, the colonial estate of Noble Jones (1702–1775). Jones was a humble carpenter who arrived in Georgia in 1733 with James Oglethorpe and the first group of settlers from England. Wormsloe's tabby ruin is the oldest standing structure in Savannah.

It's filled with history and breathtaking scenery for all to enjoy during our day.

### About Garibaldi's

Garibaldi's is in a historic, beautiful building in downtown Savannah. You'll enjoy an extensive wine list and Italian cuisine. Their specialty, though, is seafood: don't miss out on the oysters!
